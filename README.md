# Readme Generator

## Description
A great project is not complete without a great Readme file so the ease the process I made a Readme Generator! The application is written in JavaScript using the Node and Inquirer dependencies.
When a user starts the application they are given a series of prompts about their project. Once the user has completed the prompts a Readme file is automatically generated. See below for a video demonstration.
